Project Overview
Crypto Tarot is a decentralized application built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) that combines the ancient art of Tarot reading with modern blockchain technology. The application provides users with truly random Tarot readings generated using blockchain entropy, stores reading history immutably on-chain, and offers integration with Plug Wallet for donations.
Technical Architecture
The project is structured into two main components: a backend written in Motoko and a frontend built with React. The backend manages card generation, reading history, and data persistence, while the frontend provides an intuitive user interface and wallet integration.
Key Features
Our application leverages several core capabilities of the Internet Computer Protocol. First, we use blockchain entropy through the Random.blob() function to generate cryptographically secure random numbers for card selection, ensuring truly unpredictable and unbiased readings. Second, we implement Internet Identity authentication to provide secure user access. Third, we store all reading history permanently on the blockchain, allowing users to access their past readings at any time. Finally, we integrate with Plug Wallet to enable cryptocurrency donations.
Implementation Details
The backend is implemented in Motoko and includes a comprehensive Tarot deck with all 78 cards, each containing detailed descriptions and meanings for both upright and reversed positions. The card shuffling algorithm uses blockchain-based randomization to select cards and determine their orientation. User readings are stored in stable memory to persist between canister upgrades.
The frontend provides an intuitive interface built with React. It includes features for user authentication, creating new readings with different spread types (single card, three-card, or Celtic cross), viewing reading history, and making donations through Plug Wallet. The interface is responsive and designed to provide a seamless user experience.
Blockchain Integration
The project demonstrates how traditional applications can be enhanced using blockchain technology. By storing reading history on-chain, we provide transparency and permanence that traditional applications cannot match. The use of blockchain entropy for card selection ensures that readings are truly random and cannot be manipulated, adding a level of trust that is impossible with conventional random number generators.
Future Development
Future enhancements could include visualization of cards with custom artwork, additional spread types, social sharing features, and expanded payment options. The decentralized nature of the application ensures that user data remains private and secure, while the open architecture of Internet Computer allows for continuous improvement and scaling.
Conclusion
Crypto Tarot showcases the potential of Internet Computer Protocol for creating engaging, practical applications that leverage blockchain technology. By bringing the ancient tradition of Tarot reading into the blockchain era, we demonstrate how decentralized infrastructure can enhance user experiences and provide new levels of transparency and trust.
